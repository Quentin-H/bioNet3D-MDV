KnowENG Massive Dataset Visualizer Component

Notes:

- Typically I use float3 rather than vector3 because in newer versions of Unity 
anything that takes vector3 as an argument also accepts float3 and float3 does
not have many methods and therefore has a smaller overhead.

- A lot of times I use entities and nodes interchangeably. Nodes in the network are
represented as cubes, these are entities. All nodes are entities but not all entities are nodes.
